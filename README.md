# üåê Network Security Scanner with Firewall Rule Simulator

## Overview

This project is a **real-time network security scanner and traffic control simulator** built using **Python (Flask)**, **Flask-SocketIO**, and **Nmap**. It provides a fully interactive web interface for scanning hosts and managing firewall-like rules visually and intuitively.

With this tool, users can:

- Perform live port scanning using different modes (TCP SYN, UDP, and service version detection).
- Create and manage firewall simulation rules (`allow` or `deny`) by IP and port.
- See how traffic is filtered based on the applied rules ‚Äî in real time.
- Understand and visualize network-level security concepts through an educational, hands-on interface.

Whether you're learning cybersecurity, working on networking fundamentals, or building internal tools for demonstration purposes, this project gives you a simplified yet powerful sandbox to work with.

## üîß Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- `nmap` installed on your system  
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt install nmap`  
  - **macOS**: `brew install nmap`  
  - **Windows**: [Download from nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html)
  - VS Code

## Setup
### Install Python Dependencies

`pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO python-nmap`

# üí° Features
### üîç Flexible Scanning:

- TCP SYN scan

- UDP scan

- Service version detection

### üõ°Ô∏è Simulated Firewall:

- Add allow or deny rules by IP and port

- Remove rules dynamically

- Visualize rule impact on scan results

### ‚ö° Real-Time UI:

- Uses WebSockets for immediate updates

- No need to refresh or re-run manually

### üåô Dark UI Theme:

- Aesthetically styled HTML/CSS interface

- Fully responsive and accessible

# üöÄ How to Use
### Run the Flask server:

`python app.py`

### Open your browser and go to:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### On the interface:

- Enter a target IP address or hostname

- Select scan type (TCP, UDP, version)

- Click Start Scan to begin

- Add firewall rules as needed to block or allow specific traffic

- Watch the results update live based on your rules

# üéØ Use Cases
- Networking & cybersecurity education

- Visual demo for firewall behavior simulation

- Learning WebSockets and real-time interaction with Flask
